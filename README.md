# Business Intelligence & Data Analytics Suite 📊

This project demonstrates the application of Machine Learning and Data Mining techniques to solve business problems. The focus is on the complete analytical workflow: from raw data cleaning to model comparison and evaluation.

## The Analytical Workflow
The project follows a structured data science approach:
1. **Data Cleaning:** Identifying and imputing missing values and resolving inconsistencies.
2. **Preprocessing:** Feature scaling, categorical encoding, and outlier detection to prepare data for the library-based implementation.
3. **Model Execution:** Implementing 8 distinct algorithms using **Scikit-Learn** and other specialized libraries.
4. **Comparative Evaluation:** Benchmarking models based on metrics like **Accuracy, or Support/Confidence** to find the best fit for each dataset.

##  Implementation Breakdown
| Domain | Models Compared |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Classification** | KNN vs. Naive Bayes |
| **Regression** | Linear Regression vs. Random Forest |
| **Clustering** | K-Means vs. DBSCAN |
| **Association Rules** | Apriori, Eclat, and FP-Growth |

## 💻 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python
- **Libraries:** Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Mlxtend (for Association Rules)

## 📈 Key Results
By comparing the results of different models, we identified how data distribution and preprocessing choices (like scaling) directly impact the final business metrics and decision-making process.
